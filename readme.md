## ðŸš€ About Me

I am a seasoned full-stack developer with six years of professional experience, currently contributing my expertise at Udemy. Previously, I served as a key team member at Havelsan, a prominent Turkish defense company, where I actively contributed to the success of at least three projects utilizing microservices architecture. My proficiency spans Java, Spring, ReactJS, and databases such as MongoDB, DynamoDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle SQL. Additionally, I am well-versed in containerization technologies like Docker, orchestration tools like Kubernetes, and possess a strong background in the development of microservices. Furthermore, my knowledge extends to Geotools, GeoJSON, and GDAL libraries. Recognized for my ability to swiftly adapt and learn, I am deeply passionate about programming, consistently striving for excellence in my endeavors.
